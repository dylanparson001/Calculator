Calculator App

Non-scientific calculator, I made this using Javascript and CSS grid to organize the elements

Personal Challenges for this app: 
  1. Getting the logic down for processing chaining operation clicks 
  2. Geting the types for the display and input to match

How I overcame them: 
  1. Writing down step by step how to process each input keeping the previous number that was output
  2. Making all the types strings
